Measurement & Verification Characterization Tool. Paste an M&V plan, vendor methodology description, or program document and get a structured scorecard analysis across 8 dimensions:

- **Measurement Method** — What measurement approach is used
- **Boundary & Scope** — What is the measurement boundary
- **Duration & Cadence** — How long and how frequently measurements occur
- **Use Case Fit** — What this M&V approach is best suited for
- **Savings Isolation** — Ability to attribute savings to a specific measure
- **Interactive Effects** — Whether the method captures interactive effects
- **Baseline Robustness** — Quality and approach of baseline construction
- **Uncertainty Quantification** — Whether uncertainty or error is quantified
